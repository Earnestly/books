WHY?

  There are many nice articles and documents out there but many of them are
  only available to us in less than ideal formats. Either they come as a pdf
  document which has been poorly scanned into a computer without any text
  layers or they're produced with poor typesetters.
  
  As a result this repository was created to host conversions of these works to
  latex in an effort to both make reading more pleasant and give opportunity to
  generate documentation for a variety of different media devices but also for
  basic preservation of some of the more interesting artefacts from computer
  science's history.
  
  No copyright or plagarism intended.
