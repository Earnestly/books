This is a conversion of the article "Program Development by Stepwise
Refinement" written by Niklaus Wirth in 1971 to latex source.

It uses embedded Libertine Linux O and Inconsolatazi4 typefaces.  These
typefaces will need to be available.

Requires: ``xelatex``, ``latexmk`` and ``make``.
Latex packages: ``fontspec``, ``biblatex``, ``hyperref``, ``amsmath`` and ``listingsutf8``.

BUILD
-----
Run ``make``, this will produce the file ``program_development_by_stepwise_refinement.pdf``.
