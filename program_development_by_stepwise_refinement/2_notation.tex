\section{Notation}

For the description of programs, a slightly augmented \emph{Algol 60} notation
will be used.  In order to express repetition of statements in a more lucid way
than by use of labels and jumps, a statement of the form

\begin{lstlisting}
repeat $\langle$statement sequence$\rangle$
until $\langle$boolean expression$\rangle$
\end{lstlisting}

is introduced, meaning that the statement sequence is to be repeated until
the Boolean expression has obtained the value \textbf{true}.
