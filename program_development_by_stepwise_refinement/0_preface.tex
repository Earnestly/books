The creative activity of programming-to be distinguished from coding-is usually
taught by examples serving to exhibit certain techniques.  It is here
considered as a sequence of design decisions concerning the decomposition of
tasks into subtasks and of data into data structures.  The process of
successive refinement of specifications is illustrated by a short but
nontrivial example, from which a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the
art and the instruction of programming.
