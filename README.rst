There are many nice articles and documents out there but many of them are only
available to us in less than ideal formats.  Either they come as a pdf document
which has been poorly scanned into a computer without any text layers or
they're produced with poor typesetters.

As a result this repository was created to host conversions of these works to
latex in an effort to make reading more pleasant and give opportunity to
generate documentation for a variety of different media devices.
